    abstract = "The operator product expansion, of appropriate products of quark fields, is used to find the anomalous dimensions which control the short distance behavior of hadronic wave functions. This behavior in turn controls the high-Q2 limit of hadronic form factors. In particular, we relate each anomalous dimension of the nonsinglet structure functions to a corresponding logarithmic correction factor to the nominal αS(Q2)/Q2 fall off of meson form factors. Unlike the case of deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering, the operator product necessary here involves extra terms which do not contribute to forward matrix elements."

        abstract = { Summary The gap-length distribution along the tracks of ionizing particles in nuclear emulsions has been investigated, and shown to be exponential for all values of specific ionization. The coefficient of the exponential, g, is suggested as the most useful measure of the ionization. In the first part of the paper, practical visual methods of measuring g are discussed. Accuracies not far inferior to the maximum possible are obtained by counting the small proportion of gaps of lengths exceeding two or three times the average value. The ratio of the coefficient g in a given track, to that in the track of a relativistic electron, is shown to be independent of degree of development, for particles below six times plateau ionization. In the seoond part of the paper, a detailed model is proposed, which is capable of explaining the dependence of g on the velocity and charge of the ionizing particle, and on the development and sensitivity of the emulsion. }

This conclusion is in striking agreement with data for pp elastic scattering at 90° and medium energy."

Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.}",

Exclusive data and single particle inclusive measurements are summarized and some discussion of multiparticle inclusive data is included. We review many of the predictions of nonparton models including the geometrical, statistical, eikonal and bootstrap approaches. A more detailed discussion is given of the structure of models based on the hard scattering of constituents. The predictions for hadronic and electromagnetic processes based on quark counting rules and the constituent interchange model (CIM) are summarized. We present numerous comparisons with experiment and indicate the framework for the comparison with new experimental data. Recent theoretical progress in the problem of relating short distance structure of hadrons with the asymptotic behavior of form factors and fixed angle amplitudes is also reviewed. We include a brief discussion of the possible influence of new hadronic degrees of freedom on large-pT phenomena. Finally, we attempt to anticipate the type of experiments which will prove decisive in the understanding of this subject."

The importance of light-cone dynamics, the physics of large longitudinal distances, and the presence of point-like quark-gluon configurations in hadrons for the theoretical description of high-energy processes (and especially nuclear shadowing) is explained. Ways to investigate the interrelations between perturbative and nonperturbative QCD in nuclear shadowing are suggested.

We give a comprehensive review of the physics, which hinges on the interface of perturbative QCD with non-perturbative strong interactions. Color transparency is expected to occur in many kinds of quasi-exclusive reactions with either electron or hadron beams. We review the interplay of color transparency with nuclear filtering, which is the conversion of quark wave functions in hadrons to smaller transverse space dimensions by interaction with a nuclear medium. A complete description of these phenomena as a multi-scale QCD process is given in terms of light-cone matrix elements. We also review a number of other approaches, including pictures based on modeling the time evolution of hadronic wave packets and the use of hadronic interpolating states. Spin plays an intrinsic role in hard exclusive reactions and the role of spin in testing and understanding color transparency and nuclear filtering is discussed at length. We emphasize the use of data analysis procedures which have minimal model dependence while comparing and contrasting various models. We review existing experimental data and the experimental program planned at various facilities. We also discuss making use of the subject's strong scientific complementarity and potential for progress in exploring hadron physics at current and future facilities, arguing that the combination of different experiments can lead to a broad new program to study the strong interactions and hadron structure."

We address here this issue of the transverse response in pion-electroproduction by considering the contributions of high-lying (W>2GeV) nucleon resonances to pion production. The coupling strengths and form factors are obtained through resonance–parton duality. We show that in a wide range of electron energies and four-momentum transfers such a model describes all the available data very well.}

The emphasis is primarily on nuclear coherence phenomena, such as shadowing, where the key physics issue is the exploration of hadronic and quark-gluon fluctuations of a high-energy virtual photon and their passage through the nuclear medium. New developments in polarized deep-inelastic scattering on nuclei are also discussed, and more conventional binding and Fermi motion effects are summarized. The report closes with a brief outlook on vector meson electroproduction, nuclear shadowing at very large Q2 and the physics of high parton densities in QCD."

The DVCS amplitude in this limit exhibits a scaling behavior described by two-argument distributions F(x,y) which specify the fractions of the initial momentum p and the momentum transfer r ≡ p' − p carried by the constituents of the nucleon. The kernel R(x,y;ξ,η) governing the evolution of the non-forward distributions F(x,y) has a remarkable property: it produces the GLAPD evolution kernel P(xξ) when integrated over y and reduces to the Brodsky-Lepage evolution kernel V(y,η) after the x-integration. This property is used to construct the solution of the one-loop evolution equation for the flavor non-singlet part of the non-forward quark distribution."

    abstract = "Based on the H-bridge switch technique a linear beam raster system was developed in 2002. The system generates a rectangular raster pattern with highly uniform (∼95%) raster density distribution on cryogenic targets. The two raster frequencies are 24.96 and 25.08kHz. The turning time at the vertex is 200ns and the scan linearity is 98%. The beam-heating effect on the target is effectively eliminated. The new raster system allows the use of higher beam current toward 200μA in many of the experimental proposals at end station Hall A and Hall C of the Jefferson lab."

    abstract = "Hadronic reactions producing strange quarks such as the exclusive p(e,e'K+)Λ and p(e,e'K+)Σ0 reactions, or the semi-inclusive p(e,e'K+)X reaction, play an important role in studies of hadron structure and the dynamics that bind the most basic elements of nuclear physics. The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach – up to the anticipated 11-GeV beam energy in Hall C – and coincidence capability with the well-understood High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS), will allow for probes of such hadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to date. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has been constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray followed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive indices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray combination will allow for identification of kaons from 1GeV/c up to 7.2GeV/c, reaching ∼10−2 proton and 10−3 pion rejection, with kaon detection efficiency better than 95%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with 14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes. Its interior walls are covered with Gore diffusive reflector, which is superior to the commonly used Millipore paper and improved the detector performance by 35%. The inner surface of the two aerogel trays with higher refractive index is covered with Millipore paper, however, those two trays with lower aerogel refractive index are again covered with Gore diffusive reflector for higher performance. The measured mean number of photoelectrons in saturation is ∼12 for n=1.030, ∼8 for n=1.020, ∼10 for n=1.015, and ∼5.5 for n=1.011. The design details, the results of component characterization, and initial performance tests and optimization of the detector are presented."

abstractNote = {A 1.5 m long threshold gas Cerenkov detector has ben constructed and installed as part of the standard detector package in the Hall C High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) at CEBAF. Designed to operate over a range of pressures the detector should be able to discriminate electrons from pions with momenta up to 6.5 GeV/c with good efficiency. Two thin spherical mirrors with a radius 163 cm focus the light to two 5-inch photomultipliers and provide an active area of 110 cm{sup 2} in the dispersive plane and 55 cm{sup 2} in the transverse plane. A large photoelectron yield is promised by the good optical properties of the mirrors (coated with AlMgF for efficient UV reflection) and the UV transmission through the window of the Burle 8854 phototubes. The authors will describe the design and construction of the detector and will present the results of the early commissioning studies.},

For the existing High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) and Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS), design considerations, relevant construction information, and comparisons of simulated and experimental results are included. The energy resolution of the HMS and SOS calorimeters is better than σ/E∼6%/E and pion/electron ({pi}/e) separation of about 100:1 has been achieved in the energy range of 1–5GeV. Good agreement has been observed between the experimental and simulated energy resolutions, but simulations systematically exceed experimentally determined {pi}− suppression factors by close to a factor of two. For the Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS), presently under construction, details on the design and accompanying GEANT4 simulation efforts are given. The anticipated performance of the new calorimeter is predicted over the full momentum range of the SHMS. Good electron/hadron separation is anticipated by combining the energy deposited in an initial (preshower) calorimeter layer with the total energy deposited in the calorimeter."

    abstract = {With the goal of improving the analysis of quasi-elastic (e, e') and (e, e'N) experiments, ambiguities in the impulse approximation are investigated by comparing various off-shell extrapolations of the Rosenbluth cross section. It is found that these ambiguities are especially large for low incident electron energies and momentum transfers and that they can be reduced by applying various physical constraints, such as those due to Lorentz invariance and current conservation. In particular the latter is important: most off-shell cross sections that have been used do not treat this correctly and, as a consequence, in the limit of the photon point give infinite photoabsorption cross sections.}

Solutions were obtained for thicknesses of up to 0.1 radiation lengths for a complete screening approximation to the energy loss equation. The accuracy of the method was checked by comparison of results with known solutions to the diffusion equation. The formulas of Mo-Tsai and Tsai for electron straggling distributions were compared to the numerical results. Good agreement was found near the high energy end of the distribution, the numerical results being within two percent of the theoretical predictions. At the low energy end of the distribution, the numerical results differ from those predicted by as much as eight percent at thicknesses of 0.1 radiation length. The disagreement was found to be proportional to thickness traversed by the beam.}

The L2 and (L · S)2 interactions are treated semiperturbatively; their contribution reduces the overbinding of nuclear matter. However, the equilibrium kF = 1.7 fm−1 and E0 = −17.5 MeV obtained with the v14 model are both higher than their empirical values kF = 1.33 fm− and E0 = −16 MeV. We assume that the difference between the calculated and empirical E(ρ) is entirely due to three-nucleon interactions (TNI). The TNI contributions are phenomenologically added to the nuclear matter energy, and their parameters are adjusted to obtain the correct equilibrium energy, density and compressibility. The required TNI contributions appear to be of reasonable magnitude.}

Relativistic effects in the description of the final-state interactions are found not to exceed the few percent level.

    abstract = {At large proton energy, the final state interactions of the knocked out nucleon in (e,e'p) reactions off nuclear targets can be described within the eikonal approximation, treating the spectator particles as a collection of fixed scattering centers. We use a generalization of this approach, suitable to take into account the possible occurrence of color transparency, to carry out an accurate calculation of the missing momentum distribution of the process 4He(e,e'p)3H. The pattern of final state interactions effects is analyzed for different kinematical setups in the domain corresponding to 2≤Q2≤20 (GeV/c)2.}

This paper explores the frontiers of this field and shows how our prospects for the future may be modified. Nuclear structure has been determined with an unprecedented accuracy defining clearly the limits of the most advanced theoretical descriptions. Large meson exchange currents are measured Quantitatively with precision. Recent data on the electrodisintegration of deuterium at threshold and on the magnetic form factor of 3He and tritium show that the pionic exchange current is well understood. There is no satisfactory theoretical description of shorter range processes.}

    abstract = {In this report we explore the remarkable connections between light-front dynamics, its holographic mapping to gravity in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, and conformal quantum mechanics. This approach provides new insights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying confinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a relativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective confinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS space. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron spectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods described here give a precise interpretation of holographic variables and quantities in AdS space in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This leads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant light-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound-states in physical space–time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the excitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states lie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and orbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here currents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a product of poles. At large q2 the form factor incorporates the correct power-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and is dictated by the twist. At low q2 the form factor leads to vector dominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses. We briefly review in this report other holographic approaches to QCD, in particular top-down and bottom-up models based on chiral symmetry breaking. We also include a discussion of open problems and future applications.}

The model accounts for the initial- and final-state interactions (IFSI) within the relativistic multiple-scattering Glauber approximation (RMSGA). For the description of color transparency, two existing models are used. The nuclear filtering mechanism is implemented as a possible explanation for the oscillatory energy dependence of the transparency. Results are presented for the target nuclei 7Li, 12C, 27Al, and 63Cu. An approximated, computationally less intensive version of the RMSGA framework is found to be sufficiently accurate for the calculation of the nuclear transparency. After including the nuclear filtering and color transparency mechanisms, our calculations are in acceptable agreement with the data.}

    abstract = { Nuclear dynamics at short distances is one of the most fascinating topics of strong interaction physics. The physics of it is closely related to the understanding of the role of the QCD in generating nuclear forces at short distances, as well as of the dynamics of the superdense cold nuclear matter relevant to the interior of neutron stars. The emergence of high-energy electron and proton beams has led to significant recent progress in high-energy nuclear scattering experiments investigating the short-range structure of nuclei. These experiments, in turn, have stimulated new theoretical studies resulting in the observation of several new phenomena specific to the short-range structure of nuclei. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in studies of short-range correlations in nuclei and discuss their importance for advancing our understanding of the dynamics of nuclear interactions at short distances. }
