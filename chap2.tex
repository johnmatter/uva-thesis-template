\section{Summary}
Taken together, these experiments show support for the existence of CT, as well
as observation of its onset for scattering processes involving mesons.
Such evidence for processes involving hadrons has not yet been demonstrated.
This may be because the onset for a $qqq$ PLC will necessarily be higher in
$Q^2$ than that of a $q\bar{q}$ pair.

Other reviews of theoretical considerations and previous experiments can be found in
the recent articles by Dutta, Hafidi, and Strikman~\cite{Dutta_2013,Dutta_2012}.
